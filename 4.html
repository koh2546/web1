  <h2>Python이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p>Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code,[25][26] notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.<p>
